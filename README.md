# VRChat AI Companion Implementation Guide ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ®

This guide will help you integrate the AI Companion system into your VRChat world using Unity and UdonSharp.

## About This Project
# VRChat World AI Companion Architecture

## Overview

The VRChat AI Companion system works as an integrated world asset rather than a separate account. This design follows VRChat's terms of service while providing an engaging AI experience.

## System Components

### 1. In-World Components (Unity/Udon)
- **Interaction Controller**: Processes player proximity, gestures, and voice/text input
- **Avatar System**: Visual representation with animations and lip-sync
- **Audio System**: Processes speech input and outputs AI responses
- **State Manager**: Tracks conversation context and personality settings

### 2. Middleware Layer (Optional)
- **External API Gateway**: Securely connects to AI services without exposing API keys
- **Request Handler**: Formats and processes requests/responses
- **Rate Limiter**: Prevents API abuse
- **Caching**: Stores common responses to reduce API calls

### 3. AI Processing
- **Local Option**: Embedded lightweight models (for simple responses)
- **Cloud Option**: Connection to OpenAI, Claude, or other NLP services

## Data Flow

1. **Input Collection**:
   - Player approaches AI avatar
   - Voice input captured through VRChat audio system
   - Text input through world UI or chat system
   - Gesture recognition for interaction triggers

2. **Processing**:
   - Speech-to-text conversion (if voice input)
   - Context management (tracking conversation history)
   - Request formatting and sending to AI service
   - Response processing and formatting

3. **Output Delivery**:
   - Text-to-speech synthesis (if enabled)
   - Avatar animation and lip-sync
   - Visual feedback (expression changes, UI elements)
   - Response timing and pacing

## Technical Implementation

### Unity/UdonSharp Components
- **UdonBehaviour scripts** for interaction logic
- **Animation controllers** for avatar responses
- **Audio sources** for voice output
- **UI elements** for text display and configuration

### Middleware Options
- **AWS Lambda function** for secure API handling
- **Firebase Functions** for easier setup
- **Custom web service** for advanced features

## Privacy and Compliance

- No persistent storage of conversation data
- Clear indication when AI processing is active
- Player opt-out mechanism
- Configurable content filtering
  
## Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

- Unity 2019.4.31f1 (VRChat SDK compatible version)
- [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/)
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp)
- Basic understanding of Unity and VRChat world creation

## Setup Process

### 1. Project Setup

1. Create a new VRChat world project in Unity
2. Install VRChat SDK via VCC
3. Install UdonSharp via VCC
4. Import the AI Companion prefab package (AICompanion.unitypackage)

### 2. Adding the AI Companion to Your World

1. Drag the `AI_Companion_Core` prefab from the `Assets/AICompanion/Prefabs` folder into your scene
2. Position the companion where you want it in your world
3. Adjust the `Interaction Zone` to define where players can interact with the AI

### 3. Configuration

#### Basic Setup

1. Select the AI Companion object in your scene
2. In the Inspector, configure:
   - Personality types
   - Default responses
   - Interaction radius
   - Response delay

#### Avatar Setup

1. The AI needs a visual representation. You can:
   - Use the included default avatar
   - Replace with your own custom avatar model
   - Set up proper animation controller connections

#### Voice Setup

1. Configure the Audio Source component
2. Add voice clips to the `Voice Clips` array
3. Adjust volume and spatial blend settings

#### UI Integration

1. Drag the `AI_Config_Panel` prefab into your scene
2. Position it in a convenient location
3. Connect the references to the AI Companion

### 4. Advanced Setup

#### External API Integration (Optional)

To use cloud-based NLP services with your AI Companion:

1. Set up a middleware server (outside of VRChat)
2. Configure your server to handle API requests
3. Set the API endpoint in the config panel
4. Toggle "Use Local Processing" off

> **Note:** External processing requires additional setup outside of VRChat and may incur API usage costs.

#### Custom Personalities

1. Open the `AICompanionCore.cs` file in a code editor
2. Modify the `InitializeLocalResponses()` method to add your custom personalities
3. Update the personality types array
4. Compile UdonSharp scripts

### 5. Testing

1. Enter Play mode in Unity to test basic functionality
2. Build and publish your world to a private instance for full testing
3. Test with multiple users to ensure sync works properly
4. Verify all interactions and responses

## Best Practices

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Keep response patterns short and simple
  - Limit the number of audio clips
  - Use LOD (Level of Detail) for the avatar

- **User Experience:**
  - Clearly indicate when the AI is listening
  - Provide visual feedback for responses
  - Allow easy access to configuration

- **Content Guidelines:**
  - Ensure responses comply with VRChat's Community Guidelines
  - Implement content filtering for user inputs
  - Avoid sensitive topics in default responses

## Troubleshooting

- **AI Not Responding:**
  - Check interaction radius
  - Verify player detection is working
  - Ensure animations are properly connected

- **Sync Issues:**
  - Check UdonBehaviour sync mode settings
  - Verify ownership transfer logic
  - Test with multiple users

- **Performance Issues:**
  - Reduce complexity of avatar
  - Limit text animation speed
  - Optimize audio settings

## Example Scene

The package includes an example scene (`AICompanion_Demo`) demonstrating a complete setup with:

- Properly configured AI Companion
- UI control panel
- Example environment
- Testing triggers

Study this scene to understand how all components work together.

## Extending the System

You can extend the AI Companion system by:

1. Adding more complex local response patterns
2. Implementing gesture recognition
3. Creating themed personality packs
4. Developing middleware for better NLP integration
